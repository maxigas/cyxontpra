# Cybernetics, Ontology, Practice: Anti-Modern TechnoScience in the European Hacker Tradition

## Introduction

Hacker artefacts, knowledges, practices and scenes constitute an alternative engineering culture that can be characterised as anti-modern technoscience.  Stemming from a break in the 1960s cultural schock [@Wallerstein2004a], hackers’ relationship to technology rests on an approach related to the cybernetic ontology identified by @Pickering2010a and articulated in the sciences by cyberneticians.  Such an approach privileges practice over representation, performance over cognition and adaptive encounters with the unknown over the domination of Nature.  In short, it is informed and forged by an experience in the ontology of becoming.

While it has been argued that even engineers and scientists who work in the heart of modern institutions grapple with the mangle of practice in their daily routines, it has also been pointed out that neither official accounts of engineering or scientific work, nor the institutions that frame them are necessarily constructed according to such realisations.  @Pickering2010a brought a historiography of scientists (the cyberneticians) who attempted to reformulate scientific tools, theories, practices and institutions to match their experiences in the ontology of becoming.  Starting from some genealogical threads on the appropriation of cybernetics by hackers, I argue here that antimodern technoscience can be shown to be at work in our contemporary historical horizon.  Once again, rather than claiming that hackers work with an ontologically different technology than mainstream engineers, what I seek to demonstrate is that *ontology matters*.

Doing so I follow the classic SCOT approach as far as I assume a methodological relativism which is not concerned with the ontology of technology per se.  Rather, it is concerned with the technological frames that different social groups construct differently.  At the same time, I seek to extend the SCOT approach by making the social consequences of the ontological experience lived by a particular social group the centre of the investigation.  In other words, the ontological tools, conceptions and experiences of practitioners guide how they construct artefacts and knowledges, perform practices and organise institutions.  Studying hacker offers lessons on how artefacts, knowledges, practices and even organisations can be different when the mangle of practice is taken into account in a more consistent and coherent manner.
